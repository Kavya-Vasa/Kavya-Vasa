### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Kavya-Vasa/Kavya-Vasa** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

👋 Hey there! I'm Kavya Vasa, a passionate Computer Engineering student currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Somaiya Vidyavihar University. 

🎓 I'm fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software, constantly exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

💻 As an avid coder, I love diving into projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve complex problems. From building websites to optimizing algorithms, I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

🔧 When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with hardware, whether it's designing circuits, experimenting with microcontrollers, or diving into the world of embedded systems. I thrive on hands-on projects that allow me to apply my knowledge in practical ways.

🌟 I'm passionate about open source and believe in the power of collaboration to drive innovation forward. I'm excited to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact and to learn from the vibrant community of developers on GitHub.

📚 Outside of academics, I enjoy [list any hobbies or interests relevant to your profile]. Let's connect and build something awesome together! 🚀
