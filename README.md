ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Kavya Vasa, a passionate Computer Engineering student currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Somaiya Vidyavihar University. 

ðŸŽ“ I'm fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software, constantly exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

ðŸ’» As an avid coder, I love diving into projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve complex problems. From building websites to optimizing algorithms, I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

ðŸ”§ When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with hardware, whether it's designing circuits, experimenting with microcontrollers, or diving into the world of embedded systems. I thrive on hands-on projects that allow me to apply my knowledge in practical ways.

ðŸŒŸ I'm passionate about open source and believe in the power of collaboration to drive innovation forward. I'm excited to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact and to learn from the vibrant community of developers on GitHub.

ðŸ“š Outside of academics, I enjoy [list any hobbies or interests relevant to your profile]. Let's connect and build something awesome together! ðŸš€
